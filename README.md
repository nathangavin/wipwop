# WIPWOP - my yet unnamed wiki Worldbuilding project

I am worldbuilding a relatively hard sci-fi work via the method of developing a wiki describing aspects of this world.

## Contributing

To run this, clone the wiki.

* the update.sh file will use git to make sure your local copy of the wiki is up to date and open the file
* the save.sh will push your changes to the remote copy
* the built in saver should work, I think
